# Blockchain from Scratch in Golang

This is a very simple Blockchain implementation, with each Block having only
the simplest of fields. Depending on the application, new fields can be added
to each block. This was just an exercise to see how much Go I can write off the
top of my head after finishing [Todd McLeod's Course on Go](https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-to-code/learn/lecture/11922050#overview)

Code heavily inspired from: [Code your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of Go!](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-blockchain-in-less-than-200-lines-of-go-e296282bcffc)
